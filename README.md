## Mental Health Chatbot

This project is a machine learning-based chatbot that assesses mental health based on user input using text and voice recognition. The chatbot is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Tkinter for the interface. It employs an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification.

### Key Features:
- **Technologies used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Tkinter, Speech Recognition, gTTS, GridSearchCV.
- **Capabilities**: Real-time text and voice input, mental health status evaluation, and a user-friendly GUI.
- **Machine Learning**: Preprocessed text data and optimized SVM model using GridSearchCV.
- **Interface**: Tkinter-based interface that allows users to interact via both voice and text.

### How to run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `main.py` to start the chatbot.
